This is a sample integration of the Rust library for accessing the CQC backend.  This integration uses the CQC crate which can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cqc).

To build the library (do not forget to include `--release` for an optimised build)

```console
cargo build
```

To run tests

```console
./tests/run_test.sh
```

It is recommended to run the tests in the Docker container.  The Dockerfile is available in the root of the repository.
