Examples using the python library
=================================

The python library provides a way to program a protocol on a network where the nodes listen to instructions through the classical-quantum combiner (CQC) interface. In the following examples the network is simulated by SimulaQron. But the same examples could be executed on a network with real quantum hardware which allows for instructions through the CQC interface, which is the aim for the 2020 quantum internet demonstrator.

The examples below assume that you have already made your way through :doc:`GettingStarted`: you have the virtual node servers up and running, and ran the simple example of generating correlated randomness. Further examples can also be found in examples/pythonLib
